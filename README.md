# Trip-Management-System

Trip Management System will record the entire journey of the customer, as well as provide the customer with services and assist them throughout the journey.

The customer can choose a means of transportation for their journey to the destination as either bus, train or airplane. The reservation for the respective mode of transportation would be recorded in the database. It would also have the schedules of all operating vehicles.

At their destination, the customer can have their hotels reserved. The database would contain a record of all the hotels across various cities. It would also record all the reservations done at a hotel.

The database would also have information about various tourist spots across the city as well as all the restaurants available, the local transport would be provided through cabs
